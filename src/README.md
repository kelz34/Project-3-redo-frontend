# DailyLogs 
The DailyLogs App is a CRUD application that enables users to create notes for their main tasks or ideas, helping them stay organized and on track


# Technologies Used
We've used React for our frontend, using JSX to craft the user interface. On the backend, we've implemented Express as our framework to establish a robust server. Our application is deployed on Heroku connected to MongoDB Atlas. 

# Approach 
Our team organized the project into two parts: backend, frontend. We started by developing the backend. Our main focus was on building and thoroughly testing all the endpoints and HTTP request methods to ensure they functioned correctly. The backend was linked with the React frontend application.
